# ptx-multispokes
This is a matlab toolbox for designing parallel transmit (pTx) multispokes RF pulses.
You may run the demo script, `demo.m`, to grab an idea of how this toolbox can be used to design pTx multispokes pulses. 
Note that the pulse designer relies on regularization tools (regtools) downloadable at http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~pcha/Regutools/.

If you use the toolbox, please consider citing the following paper:
